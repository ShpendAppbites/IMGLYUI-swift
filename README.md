# IMGLY UI

This package contains the Swift version of the IMG.LY UI for the _Creative Engine_, the UI for CE.SDK.
The Creative Engine enables you to build any design editing UI, automation and creative workflow in Swift.
It offers performant and robust graphics processing capabilities combining the best of layout, typography and image processing with advanced workflows centered around templating and adaptation.

The Creative Engine seamlessly integrates into any iOS app whether you are building a photo editor, template-based design tool or scalable automation of content creation for your app.

customize the engine for your specific use case.
